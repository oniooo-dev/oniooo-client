        These Terms do not intend to limit your rights and remedies at law, including any
        of your Consumer Law Rights.

        1. Engagement and Term

        1.1 These Terms apply from when you sign up for an Account, until the date on which
        your Account is terminated in accordance with these Terms. We grant you a right to use

        after notification (whichever date is earlier), you agree to the amended Terms. If you do
        not agree to the amendment, you may close your Account with effect from the date of
        the change in these Terms by providing written notice to us. If you cancel your Account:
        (a) you will no longer be able to access our Services (including our Platform) from the
        date of cancellation; and

        refund.

        (collectively, our Services).

        2.2 If you require Support Services, you may request these by getting in touch with us
        through our Platform.

        2.3 Where we require access to your premises or computer systems in order to

        these Terms or on our Platform.

        2.5 Additional Services: If you require additional services, we may, in our sole
        discretion, provide such additional services (to be scoped and priced in a separate
        contract provided by us).

        2.6 Third Party Products or Services: Where you engage third parties to operate
        alongside our Services (for example, any third-party software systems you wish to
        integrate with our Platform), those third parties are independent of us and you are
        responsible for (meaning we will not be liable for) the goods or services they provide,
        unless we expressly agree otherwise under clause 2.5.

        3. Account

        3.1 You must sign up for an Account in order to access and use our Services and
        Platform.

        (a) keep your information up-to-date (and ensure it remains true, accurate and
        complete);

        (b) keep usernames and passwords secure and confidential, and protect them
        from misuse or being stolen; and

        more of inactivity), we may close and permanently delete your Account. You
        acknowledge and agree that this means you will lose any Content you generated. We
        will notify you via the email address you provided when creating your Account prior to
        deleting your Account.

        4. Purchasing Mochis
        4.1 Once you have created your Account, you may purchase mochis, which serve as
        the currency for accessing features and services on our Platform. Details about the
        purchasing process, including pricing and available packages of mochis, will be
        outlined on our Platform.
        4.2 All purchases of mochis are processed as one-time payments. Once purchased,
        mochis will be credited to your Account and can be used to access various services
        and features on the Platform.

        these Terms, you authorize our nominated third-party payment processor to debit your
        bank account in accordance with your purchase of mochis, and you confirm that you
        are either the holder or an authorized signatory of that bank account.
        4.6 Cancellation: Your purchase of mochis is final and non-refundable.
        4.8 Late Payments: If any payments for mochis are not completed, we may restrict
        certain features or functionalities of your Account until the payment is resolved.
        4.9 Taxes: You are responsible for paying any levies or taxes associated with your
        purchase of mochis, such as sales taxes, value-added taxes, or withholding taxes
        (unless we are required by law to collect these on your behalf).

        6. Availability, Disruption and Downtime

        6.1 While we strive to always make our Services available to you, we do not make
        any promises that these will be available 100% of the time. Our Services may be
        disrupted during certain periods, including, for example, as a result of scheduled or

        6.2 Our Services (including our Platform) may interact with, or be reliant on, products
        or services provided by third parties, such as cloud hosting service providers. To the
        maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for disruptions or downtime caused
        or contributed to by these third parties.

        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A

        YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT ANY USE OF OUTPUTS FROM OUR SERVICE IS
        AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND YOU WILL NOT RELY ON OUTPUT AS A SOLE SOURCE
        OF TRUTH OR FACTUAL INFORMATION, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR
        PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.

        8. Ownership of Inputs & Outputs

        8.1 You may be permitted to submit text, documents, images, videos or other inputs
        to our Service (Inputs) and receive output generated and returned by the Services
        based on the Inputs (Outputs). Inputs and Outputs are collectively referred to as
        Content.

        8.2 You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services. By submitting
        Inputs to our Service, you represent, warrant and agree that you have all rights, licenses
        and permissions necessary for us to use and process the Inputs and to generate
        Outputs. You retain ownership of any Inputs.

        8.3 If you create any Content while using the Platform, ownership of all Intellectual
        Property Rights in such Content will vest in you upon creation. To the extent that
        ownership of such Intellectual Property Rights does not automatically vest in you, we
        hereby assign all such Intellectual Property Rights to you and agree to take all
        necessary actions to assure your title to such rights, subject to your compliance with
        these Terms.

        8.4 You grant us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, non-
        sublicensable (other than to our related corporate affiliates) and non-transferable right

        and license to use any Private Content solely for the purpose of fulfilling our obligations
        or exercising our rights under these Terms. We will not use, retain, analyze, or process
        your Inputs for any other purpose, including training AI models, developing new
        offerings, or for any commercial purpose, without your express written consent.

        8.6 You grant us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide and
        transferable right and licence to use, reproduce, modify, copy, process, adapt, publish,
        transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display and distribute any Public Content

        models, developing new offerings, or for any commercial purpose.

        8.7 When you create any Output while using the Platform, ownership of all Intellectual
        Property Rights in such Output will vest in you upon creation. To the extent that
        ownership of such Intellectual Property Rights does not automatically vest in you, you

        actions to ensure our title to such rights.

        8.8 If you (if you are an individual) or any of your personnel have any Moral Rights in

        (and will procure that your personnel) consent to our use or infringement of those Moral
        Rights.

        9. Ownership of Services, Platform and Data

        9.1 We own all intellectual property rights in our Services (including our Platform).
        This includes how our Platform looks and functions, as well as our copyrighted works,
        trademarks, inventions, designs and other intellectual property, including Our Materials.
        You agree not to copy or otherwise misuse our intellectual property without our written
        permission (for example, to reverse engineer or discover the source code of our
        intellectual property), and you must not alter or remove any confidentiality, copyright or
        other ownership notice placed on our Platform. Nothing in these Terms constitutes a
        transfer or assignment of any Intellectual Property Rights in Our Materials.

        9.2 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, we will own all Intellectual Property
        Rights in any developments, modifications, enhancements or improvements to the
        Platform or Our Materials (Platform Developments). To the extent that any Platform
        Developments do not automatically vest in us by operation of law, you hereby assign all
        Intellectual Property Rights in such Platform Developments to us and agree to do all
        other things necessary to assure our title in such rights.

        9.3 We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free, worldwide, non-
        sublicensable, and non-transferable right and license to use our materials that we

        provide to you solely for your personal use and enjoyment of our Services, as

        contemplated by these Terms. This license is granted for as long as you have an active
        account with us.

        9.4 We may use any feedback or suggestions that you give us in any manner which
        we see fit (for example, to develop new features), and no benefit will be owed to you as
        a result of any use by us of your feedback or suggestions.

        9.5 When you use our Services, we may create anonymised statistical data from your
        usage of our Services (for example, through aggregation). Once anonymised, we own
        that data and may use it for our own purposes, such as to provide and improve our
        Services, to develop new services or product offerings, to identify business trends, and
        for other uses we communicate to you. This may include making such anonymised data
        publicly available, provided it is not compiled using a sample size small enough to make
        your data or identity identifiable.

        10. Confidential Information and Personal Information

        10.1 While using our Services, you may share confidential information with us, and
        you may become aware of confidential information about us. You agree not to use our
        confidential information, and to take reasonable steps to protect our confidential
        information from being disclosed without our permission, and we agree to do the same
        for your confidential information. This also means making sure that any Authorized
        Users, employees, contractors, professional advisors or agents of ours or yours only
        have access to confidential information on a ‘need-to-know basis’ (in other words, the
        disclosure is absolutely necessary), and that they also agree to not misuse or disclose
        such confidential information.

        10.2 However, either you or we may share confidential information with legal or
        regulatory authorities if required by law to do so.

        10.3 We collect, hold and disclose and use any Personal Information you provide to
        us in accordance with our privacy policy, available on our website, and applicable
        privacy laws.

        10.4 You must only disclose Personal Information to us if you have the right to do so
        (such as having the individual’s express consent).

        10.5 We may need to disclose Personal Information to third parties, such as our
        related companies or our service providers (for example, IT and administrative service
        providers and our professional advisors).

        10.6 Where we are required by law to report on our activities, you acknowledge that
        from time to time we may request certain information from you in order to meet our
        requirements, and you agree to provide us with such information within the timeframes
        reasonably requested by us.

        11. Consumer Law Rights

        11.1 In some jurisdictions, you may have guarantees, rights or other remedies
        provided by law (Consumer Law Rights), and these Terms do not restrict your
        Consumer Law Rights. We will only be bound by your Consumer Law Rights and the
        express wording of these Terms.

        11.2 If you accept these Terms in Quebec, nothing in these Terms should be
        interpreted to exclude, restrict or modify the application of, or any rights or remedies you
        may have under, the Consumer Protection Act of Quebec. If our Platform is not
        ordinarily used for personal, household, or domestic use, our liability for a breach of
        your consumer rights under this Act is limited to either resupplying our Services, or
        paying the cost of having our Services resupplied.

        12. Liability

        12.1 NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE
        LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
        EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
        GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE
        LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE
        AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING
        THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
        ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM
        EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

        12.2 Some countries and states do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties or
        the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the terms above may not apply to
        you, and you may have additional rights. In that case, these Terms only limit our
        responsibilities to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.

        12.3 GROUP IMI’S AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS
        ARE INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS SECTION.

        13. Suspension and Termination

        13.1 We may suspend your access to our Services where:

        (a) we reasonably believe there has been any unauthorized access to or use of our
        Services (such as the unauthorized sharing of login details for our Platform);

        (b) you have transmitted or inputted to our Platform any Inputs that may be
        offensive, or any material in violation of any law; or

        (c) you have otherwise breached clause 5.2.

        13.2 If we suspend your access to our Services, we will let you know within a
        reasonable time of doing so, and we will work with you to resolve the matter within 15
        days, or if it cannot be resolved, then we may terminate your Account and your access
        to our Services will end.

        13.3 We may terminate these Terms (which means you will lose access to our
        Services, including your Account, and any purchased items will be cancelled) if:
        (a) you breach these Terms and do not remedy that breach within 15 days of us
        notifying you of the breach. You acknowledge and agree that we may, in our sole
        discretion, immediately ban you if we reasonably believe that you are in breach
        of clause 5 (Platform License) of these Terms;
        (b) you breach these Terms and that breach cannot be remedied; or

        (c) you experience an insolvency event (including but not limited to bankruptcy,
        receivership, voluntary administration, liquidation, or entering into creditors’
        schemes of arrangement).

        13.4 You may terminate these Terms if:
        (a) we breach these Terms and do not remedy that breach within 15 days of you
        notifying us of that breach; or
        (b) we breach these Terms and that breach cannot be remedied. In such cases,
        if you have made any advance payments for purchased items, you will be issued
        a pro-rata refund based on the portion of the unused services or items remaining.
        13.5 You may also terminate these Terms at any time by notifying us through your
        Account or by sending an email to our designated email for notices (as set out in clause
        15.8). Termination will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged for any
        future purchases after the date of termination.
        13.6 Termination of these Terms will not affect any other rights or liabilities that we or
        you may have accrued prior to termination.

        dispute, controversy or claim arising from, or in connection with, these Terms (including
        any question regarding its existence, validity or termination) (Dispute) unless we and
        you first meet (in good faith) to resolve the Dispute. Nothing in this clause will operate to
        prevent us or you from seeking urgent injunctive or equitable relief from a court of
        appropriate jurisdiction.

        If the Dispute is not resolved at that initial meeting:

        (a) where you are resident or incorporated in Quebec, refer the matter to
        mediation, administered by the Institut de médiation et d'arbitrage du Québec (IMAQ) in
        accordance with the IMAQ Mediation Rules; or
        (b) where you are not resident or incorporated in Quebec, refer the matter to
        arbitration administered by the Arbitration and Mediation Institute of Canada, Quebec

        Section, with such arbitration to be conducted in Montreal, Quebec, before one
        arbitrator, in French or English, and in accordance with the Canadian Arbitration
        Association Arbitration Rules

        15.3 Events Outside Our Control: We will not be liable for any delay or failure to
        perform our obligations (including our Services), if such delay or failure is caused or
        contributed to by an event or circumstance beyond our reasonable control.

        15.4 These Terms are governed by the laws of Quebec, and any matter relating to
        these Terms is to be determined exclusively by the courts in Quebec and any courts
        entitled to hear appeals from those courts.

        15.5 Illegal Requests: We reserve the right to refuse any request for or in relation to
        our Services that we deem inappropriate, unethical, unreasonable, illegal or otherwise
        non-compliant with these Terms.

        15.6 Marketing: You agree that we may send you electronic communications about
        our products and services. You may opt-out at any time by using the unsubscribe
        function in our electronic communications.

        15.7 Nature of Legal Relationship: These Terms do not create, and should not be
        interpreted so as to create, a partnership, joint venture, employment or agency
        relationship between us and you.

        15.8 Notices: Any notice you send to us must be sent to the email set out at the
        beginning of these Terms. Any notice we send to you will be sent to the email address
        registered against your Account.

        15.9 Survival: Clauses 7 to 12 will survive the termination or expiry of these Terms.

        15.10 Third Party Sites: Our Platform may contain links to websites operated by third
        parties. Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not control, endorse or approve, and are
        not responsible for, the content on those websites. We recommend that you make your
        own investigations in relation to the suitability of those websites. If you purchase goods
        or services from a third party website linked from our Platform, those goods or services
        are being provided by that third party, not us. We may receive a benefit (which may
        include a referral fee or a commission) should you visit certain third party websites

        through a link on our Platform, or for featuring certain goods or services on our Platform.
        We will make it clear by notice to you which (if any) goods or services, or website links,
        we receive a benefit from by featuring them on our Platform.
